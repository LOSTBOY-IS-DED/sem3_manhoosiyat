# College C Assignments

This repository contains the C assignments I worked on during my time in college. Instead of building cool stuff, I spent countless hours on these tasks. Feel free to explore, critique, or learn from my journey with C programming.

## Repository Structure

All assignments are stored in the main folder. The structure looks like this:
```

.
├── q1.c
├── q2.c
├── q3.c
└── README.md

````

Currently, the repository contains the following assignments:

1. **q1.c**: Basic array operations (insert, delete, search, etc.)

More assignments will be uploaded one by one.

## Getting Started

To run the assignments, you need a C compiler installed on your machine. You can use GCC, Clang, or any other standard C compiler.

### Using GCC

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/college-c-assignments.git
   cd college-c-assignments
````

2. Compile the C file:

   ```sh
   gcc -o q1 q1.c
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./q1
   ```

## Contributing
